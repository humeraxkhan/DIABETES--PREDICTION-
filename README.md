# FAKENEWS-DETECTION
1.Import all the needed libraries such as NumPy , Pandas , Sklearn , Matplotlib .The news dataset from the Kaggle we have taken the train csv file.

2. Identify the StopWords in English then Load the dataset to a pandas DataFrame.
3. Count the number of missing values in the dataset.Check how many rows and column the dataset has. Replace the null values with empty string . Explore each variable and identify itâ€™s shape.
4. Merge the author name and news title . Rename it as Content. Separate the data & label.
5. Remove the commoner morphological and inflexional endings from words in English using Porter Stemmer. The resultant stem is a shorter word with the same root meaning.
6.Identify the shape of the label and then convert the textual data to numerical data. Using Tf-idfVectorizer and then fit and transform that numeric converted data .
7. Train , Test and split data with random state . In other word, ensure that the same randomization is used each time you run the code, resulting in the same splits of the data.
8.Run the below mentioned model and find accuracy, classification report and confusion metrics using Logistic regression and Decision Tree.
9.Find the Variable that impacts the most and make WordCloud of Real and Fake Words in that particular dataset.
10.Make graph of Top 20 frequent words that are in the dataset
